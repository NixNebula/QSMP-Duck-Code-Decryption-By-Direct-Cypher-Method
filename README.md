# QSMP-Duck-Code-Decryption-By-Direct-Cypher-Method
Minecraft QSMP project. This script checks if the used method for one of the encrypted messages is the direct cypher. The encrypted message in question is "jdbtb 7tjb t7jdb tyj". It is assumed that the message is either in English or in Spanish. A database of around 1 and a half million words is used to implement this semi-brute force method.
